# C4 Model

C4 modelling technique is one of the newest architecture notations. The main concern of C4 is simplicity, so it should replace messy "boxes and arrows" diagrams in everyday usage.

## Summary

The cornerstones of C4 are 4 levels of abstractions: `context`, `containers`, `components` and `code`

- **context** -- on this abstraction level we can see how our system interact with other systems or 3rdparty services
- **containers** -- this is a high-level representation of our system. Here we show our deployment units and data sources.
  > pls don't confuse with Docker containers
- **components** -- it can be .Net assemblies or Java/Scala packages or something similar from your perfect lang
- **code** -- yep, this is a bunch of UML diagrams

## Proc and Cons

### Proc:
- **it's very simple!** Archimate, IDEF or even BPMN are much more complicated
- **good tooling** C4 supported by many tools, but if your stack based on Java, C#, Python or Node you should try a Structurizr!
- **you should not consolidate a lot of views** -- C4 doesn't have viewpoints, so your diagrams will be always consistent

### Cons:
- **it's quite messy** -- because on *containers* layer(most important?) you should draw applications, data sources and infrastructure it will be too complicated on large landscapes
- **you can't draw some viewpoints** For example dataflow
