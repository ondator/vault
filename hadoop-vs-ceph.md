# HDFS vs Object Storages

Here is some comparision in proc and cons format between HDFS(distributed file system from Hadoop ecosystem) and S3-like Object Storage Systems(Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage and Ceph)

| HDFS | S3 |
|------|----|
| | + can work effictively with all file size(has no block size)|
| + has large ecosystem over it | |
| + out of the box crosskey consistency guarantees | |
| | + has no single point of failure (name node)|
