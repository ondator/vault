# Toyota Production system

This notes based on "Toyota way" book by J. Liker. It's about Toyota Production System which is somekind of philosophy of Toyota company. It's intertwined with Theory of constraints by Goldradt but also inspire to continous improvement and respect to every employee and so on

## Kaidzen
Kaidzen -- is process of continous improvement which is one of the basic process of TPS. The main idea is
+ all idea should be driven by field-workers (workers/engeneers/etc, not by management)
+ it should be implemented throught PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles

I think that in IT sphere it could be somekind of weekly with-beer meetings where everyone could deliver his pains and introduce his ideas to improve process/practices/standarts. Seems like it will be great to start such session by myself to ginger up the discussion
